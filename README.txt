In order for the notification to come in telegrams, you need to start the bot. To do this, go to the address: https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=@Task_manager_new_bot or find the bot by its name: task_manager_new_bot. Also add the file "token_telegram_bot.txt" with the decrypted token to the root with jar files.
