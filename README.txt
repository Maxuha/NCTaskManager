In order for the notification to come in telegrams, you need to start the bot. To do this, go to the address: https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=@Task_manager_new_bot or find the bot by its name: task_manage_new_bot. Also, the decoded file with the token must be moved to the root with the jar file. The file name should be like this: token_telegram_bot.txt.secret
